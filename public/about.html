<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Silvia Galli, I was born in Cattolica (Italy) in 1995. In highschool I studied languages, in particular
  english, french and german. I don't really remember much of the german language, but I'm pretty good with english. 
  After highschool I went to university, where I studied Economics and Languages. Here, I decided to get a deeper 
  knowledge of english and french.

<p>University made me dive into a world I didn't like at all: companies. I worked as a secretary for a couple years,
  just to earn some money, but when I began to work full-time in a company I felt completely out of my space. The 
  job was boring, easy, repetitive and not self rewarding. I felt the need to change and the only little spark I had 
  left inside me was the desire to make my very own e-commerce. So I did, I used shopify to create my website and with
  the help of chatgpt I tried to modify little pieces of code. It was a total failure and I'm not talking about the code.
  I shut the website off after one hard year and again, found myself with no idea of what to do with my life.
